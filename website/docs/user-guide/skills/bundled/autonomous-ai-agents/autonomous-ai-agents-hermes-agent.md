# Hermes Agent

Hermes Agent is an open-source AI agent framework by Nous Research that runs in your terminal, a native desktop app, messaging platforms, and IDEs. It's in the same category as Claude Code (Anthropic), Codex (OpenAI), and OpenClaw — autonomous coding and task-execution agents that use tool calling to interact with your system. Hermes works with any LLM provider (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, xAI, local models, and 20+ others) and runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, and WSL.

What makes Hermes different:

- **Self-improving through skills** — Hermes learns from experience by saving reusable procedures as skills that load into future sessions.
- **Persistent memory across sessions** — remembers who you are, your preferences, environment details, and lessons learned. Pluggable memory backends.
- **Multi-platform gateway** — the same agent runs on Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, Matrix, Teams, Email, and a dozen more platforms with full tool access, not just chat.
- **Many surfaces** — the same agent core drives the CLI, the Ink TUI, a native Electron desktop app, a web dashboard, and an ACP server for IDEs (VS Code / Zed / JetBrains).
- **Provider-agnostic** — swap models and providers mid-workflow; credential pools rotate across multiple API keys automatically.
- **Profiles** — run multiple independent Hermes instances with isolated configs, sessions, skills, and memory.
- **Extensible & themeable** — plugins, MCP servers, custom tools, webhook triggers, cron scheduling, skins that theme every surface, desktop UI plugins, TUI widgets, and pet mascots.

**This skill is a hub.** The body covers identity, quick start, spawning/orchestration, and hard invariants. Everything else lives in reference files — **load the matching reference (below) before answering**; do not answer detail questions from the body alone.

**Docs:** https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/

## Scope & Verification

This skill is a concise operating guide, not the complete source of truth for every Hermes feature. If a Hermes feature, command, or setting is not mentioned here or in a reference, do not treat that absence as evidence that it does not exist. Check the live repository and official docs before giving a negative answer.

Good verification targets, cheapest first:

- **Every shipped feature, one line each: https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/llms.txt.** Start here for any "can Hermes do X?" or "how do I do X?" — it indexes the entire documentation set with a link to the page that answers. It is generated from the docs tree on every build, so it is never behind the product. Fetch it with `web_extract`, or `curl -s https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/llms.txt` when web tools are off. The whole documentation set in one file is at `/docs/llms-full.txt`.
- CLI commands: `hermes --help`, `hermes <command> --help`, and `hermes_cli/main.py`
- Source tree: https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent

Never answer "Hermes can't do that" from memory. Hermes ships far more than this skill body describes, and the index exists so a negative answer is always checkable.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (shell installer — sets up uv, Python, the venv, and the launcher)
curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash

# Interactive chat (default surface; set display.interface: tui to launch the Ink TUI instead)
hermes

# Single query
hermes chat -q "What is the capital of France?"

# Setup wizard  /  pick model+provider  /  health check
hermes setup
hermes model
hermes doctor

# Other surfaces
hermes desktop                 # launch the native desktop app (alias: hermes gui)
hermes dashboard               # web admin panel + embedded chat
hermes proxy                   # OpenAI-compatible local proxy backed by your OAuth provider
```

## Key Paths

```
~/.hermes/config.yaml       Main configuration (settings — never secrets)
~/.hermes/.env              API keys and secrets ONLY (under $HERMES_HOME if set)
$HERMES_HOME/skills/        Installed skills
~/.hermes/skins/            Custom themes (see references/themes.md)
~/.hermes/desktop-plugins/  Desktop app UI plugins (see references/desktop-plugins.md)
~/.hermes/tui-widgets/      TUI widget apps (see references/tui-widgets.md)
~/.hermes/pets/             Installed pet mascots (see references/petdex.md)
~/.hermes/state.db          Canonical session store (SQLite + FTS5)
~/.hermes/sessions/         Gateway routing index, request dumps, *.jsonl transcripts
~/.hermes/logs/             Gateway and error logs
~/.hermes/auth.json         OAuth tokens and credential pools
~/.hermes/hermes-agent/     Source code (if git-installed)
```

Profiles use `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/` with the same layout.

### Display verbosity (per-platform · per-chat · per-cron-job)

Hermes controls how much of the agent's intermediate work (tool calls,
reasoning, "still working" heartbeats, interim status messages) is shown. There
are three layers, each narrower than the last:

1. **Per-platform** — `display.platforms.<platform>.*` (e.g. quiet Telegram, verbose Discord).
2. **Per-chat** — `display.chat_overrides.<chat_id>` / `display.quiet_chats` — override verbosity for one chat/topic/DM, even on a platform whose default differs. Applies to interactive sessions **and** cron deliveries into that chat.
3. **Per-cron-job** — `delivery_verbosity` on a job — controls how much of a cron run's output is delivered.

**Verbosity modes** (used by `chat_overrides.<id>.mode` and `quiet_chats`):

| Mode | tool_progress | interim messages | heartbeats | reasoning | delivery |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| `verbose` | all | yes | yes | yes | full |
| `normal` | (falls through to the platform default — no override) | | | | full |
| `quiet` | off | no | no | no | final answer only |
| `silent` | off | no | no | no | nothing (cron: no delivery on success) |

Explicit individual keys on a chat entry win over its `mode` preset (e.g.
`mode: quiet` + `show_reasoning: true` keeps reasoning in that one chat).

**Resolution order — interactive:** per-chat override → per-platform setting → built-in platform tier → global default. (`mode: normal`, or a preset that doesn't define a setting, falls through unchanged.)

**Resolution order — cron delivery:** per-job `delivery_verbosity` → per-chat override at the delivery target (`mode: quiet`/`quiet_chats` ⇒ `result_only`; `mode: silent` ⇒ `silent`) → default `full`.

**Per-cron-job `delivery_verbosity`** values: `full` (default — output as produced), `result_only` (final answer only, reasoning/trace stripped), `summary` (one-line status + final answer trimmed to ~280 chars), `silent` (deliver nothing on success — but **failures always deliver** so a broken job can't fail silently).

#### Config example — mixed public/private Telegram

```yaml
# config.yaml
display:
  platforms:
    telegram:
      tool_progress: "off"          # platform-wide default
  chat_overrides:
    "-1001234567890":               # customer-facing group → clean answers only
      mode: quiet
    "256875587":                    # your private DM → full detail
      mode: verbose
    "-1009876543210":               # team dev channel, mostly quiet…
      mode: quiet
      show_reasoning: true          # …but keep reasoning visible here
  quiet_chats:                      # shorthand: these chat ids imply mode: quiet
    - "-1005550000000"
```

#### Cron example — mail check delivers only the result

```jsonc
// jobs.json (or via the cronjob tool: cronjob(action='create', ..., delivery_verbosity='result_only'))
{
  "id": "3c5220ab270e",
  "name": "Mailbox check",
  "schedule": "every 15m",
  "deliver": "origin",
  "delivery_verbosity": "result_only"   // final answer only; the tool-call trace is dropped
}
```

Set it from the tool: `cronjob(action='update', job_id='3c5220ab270e', delivery_verbosity='silent')` (pass an empty string to clear back to `full`). A cron job whose delivery target chat is `mode: quiet` automatically delivers `result_only` even without a per-job value; a `silent` target suppresses successful deliveries.

Both features are backward-compatible: absent `chat_overrides`/`quiet_chats` and absent `delivery_verbosity` mean exactly the current per-platform behavior.

## Project Context Files

Hermes injects project-level instructions into the system prompt by reading context files from the working directory. The discovery order is **first match wins** — only one project context source is loaded per session.

| File (in priority order) | Discovery | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `.hermes.md` / `HERMES.md` | Walks parents up to the git root, stops at git root | You want hierarchical project rules (root + per-package overrides) |
| `AGENTS.md` / `agents.md` | **Cwd only** — subdirectory and parent copies are ignored | You want portable agent instructions that work the same in Hermes, Claude Code, Codex, etc. |
| `CLAUDE.md` / `claude.md` | Cwd only | Same as AGENTS.md, Claude-flavored |
| `.cursorrules` / `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | Cwd only | Migrating from Cursor |

`SOUL.md` (in `$HERMES_HOME`) is independent and always loaded when present — it sets the agent's identity, not project rules.

### Pick the right one

- **Use `.hermes.md`** when you want Hermes-specific behavior that lives above the cwd (root + subtree), or when you want rules to inherit from a parent directory. The parent walk stops at the git root, so a home-level `.hermes.md` won't leak into every project (a git repo's root is the boundary).
- **Use `AGENTS.md`** when the same project will also be worked on by other agents (Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode). Those tools all have their own conventions for `AGENTS.md`, and the "cwd only" contract keeps the file portable.
- **Don't put project rules in `~/.hermes/AGENTS.md`** (or any other home-level location). When Hermes runs with that directory as cwd, the file loads — but only for that one directory. For cross-project context, use `SOUL.md` (in `$HERMES_HOME`, identity-only) or install a skill via `hermes skills install`.

### Size and truncation

Each context file is capped at 20,000 characters. Files longer than that get **head + tail** truncated (the middle is dropped, with a `[...truncated...]` marker). For large project rules, prefer splitting into multiple skills over cramming one file.

### Security

All context files pass through the threat-pattern scanner before reaching the system prompt. Patterns matching prompt injection or promptware are replaced with a `[BLOCKED: ...]` placeholder. This means an `AGENTS.md` containing obvious injection attempts won't reach the model — the scanner blocks the content, not the file, so the rest of the file still loads.

### Disable for one session

`hermes --ignore-rules` skips auto-injection of all project context files (`.hermes.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`) **and** `SOUL.md` identity, plus user config, plugins, and MCP servers. Use it to isolate whether a problem is your setup or Hermes itself.

### Example: a small `.hermes.md`

```markdown
# My Project

Hermes: when working in this repo, follow these rules.

## Build
- Always run `make test` before declaring a change done.
- Use `uv run` for Python, not `pip install`.

## Style
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` over `os.path`.
- No `print()` in production code — use the `logger`.
```

That file at `~/projects/myrepo/.hermes.md` is auto-loaded when Hermes runs in any subdirectory of `~/projects/myrepo`, but not when it runs in `~/other-project`.

## Security & Privacy Toggles

Common "why is Hermes doing X to my output / tool calls / commands?" toggles — and the exact commands to change them. Most of these need a fresh session (`/reset` in chat, or start a new `hermes` invocation) because they're read once at startup.

### Secret redaction in tool output

Secret redaction is **on by default** — tool output (terminal stdout, `read_file`, web content, subagent summaries, etc.) is scanned for strings that look like API keys, tokens, and secrets before it enters the conversation context and logs. Leave it enabled for normal use:

```bash
hermes config set security.redact_secrets true       # keep enabled globally
```

**Restart required.** `security.redact_secrets` is snapshotted at import time — toggling it mid-session (e.g. via `export HERMES_REDACT_SECRETS=false` from a tool call) will NOT take effect for the running process. Tell the user to change it in config from a terminal, then start a new session. This is deliberate — it prevents an LLM from flipping the toggle on itself mid-task.

Disable only when you deliberately need raw credential-like strings for debugging or redactor development:
```bash
hermes config set security.redact_secrets false
```

### PII redaction in gateway messages

Separate from secret redaction. When enabled, the gateway hashes user IDs and strips phone numbers from the session context before it reaches the model:

```bash
hermes config set privacy.redact_pii true    # enable
hermes config set privacy.redact_pii false   # disable (default)
```

### Command approval prompts

By default (`approvals.mode: smart`), Hermes asks an auxiliary LLM to assess shell commands flagged as destructive (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, etc.). The modes are:

- `smart` — auto-approve a low-risk command once, deny high-risk commands, and prompt when uncertain (default)
- `manual` — always prompt
- `off` — skip all approval prompts (equivalent to `--yolo`)

```bash
hermes config set approvals.mode smart       # recommended middle ground
hermes config set approvals.mode off         # bypass everything (not recommended)
```

Per-invocation bypass without changing config:
- `hermes --yolo …`
- `export HERMES_YOLO_MODE=1`

Note: YOLO / `approvals.mode: off` does NOT turn off secret redaction. They are independent.

### Shell hooks allowlist

Some shell-hook integrations require explicit allowlisting before they fire. Managed via `~/.hermes/shell-hooks-allowlist.json` — prompted interactively the first time a hook wants to run.

### Disabling the web/browser/image-gen tools

To keep the model away from network or media tools entirely, open `hermes tools` and toggle per-platform. Takes effect on next session (`/reset`). See the Tools & Skills section above.

## Voice & Transcription

### STT (Voice → Text)

Voice messages from messaging platforms are auto-transcribed.

Provider priority (auto-detected):
1. **Local faster-whisper** — free, no API key: `pip install faster-whisper`
2. **Groq Whisper** — free tier: set `GROQ_API_KEY`
3. **OpenAI Whisper** — paid: set `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY`
4. **Mistral Voxtral** — set `MISTRAL_API_KEY`

Config:
```yaml
stt:
  enabled: true
  provider: local        # local, groq, openai, mistral
  local:
    model: base          # tiny, base, small, medium, large-v3
```

### TTS (Text → Voice)

| Provider | Env var | Free? |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Edge TTS | None | Yes (default) |
| ElevenLabs | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Free tier |
| OpenAI | `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY` | Paid |
| MiniMax | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | Paid |
| Mistral (Voxtral) | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | Paid |
| NeuTTS (local) | None (`pip install neutts[all]` + `espeak-ng`) | Free |

Voice commands: `/voice on` (voice-to-voice), `/voice tts` (always voice), `/voice off`.

---
Profiles use `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/` with the same layout. When a profile is active, resolve the real home from `$HERMES_HOME` — never hardcode `~/.hermes`.

## Routing Table — load the reference for the task

| User wants... | Load |
|---|---|
| **Anything not listed below — "can Hermes do X?", "how do I set up X?"** | **https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/llms.txt** |
| Bots that chat, run routines, or message each other; the Bots tab | docs: `/user-guide/bot-mode` |

The reference list above is not the feature list — it is the set of topics that
need more than their docs page. For everything else Hermes ships, fetch
`llms.txt` and it maps the question to the page that answers it.

Two theming rules that hold even without loading the reference: **you apply skins yourself** (`hermes config set display.skin <name>` — every surface repaints live within ~a second; don't tell the user to run `/skin`), and **to tweak one color, edit the ACTIVE skin** (`hermes skin set <key> <hex>`) — never fork `default`, which drops the palette and resets the background.

## Spawning Additional Hermes Instances

Run additional Hermes processes as fully independent subprocesses — separate sessions, tools, and environments.

### When to Use This vs delegate_task

| | `delegate_task` | Spawning `hermes` process |
|-|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Isolation | Separate conversation, shared process | Fully independent process |
| Duration | Minutes (bounded by parent loop) | Hours/days |
| Tool access | Subset of parent's tools | Full tool access |
| Interactive | No | Yes (PTY mode) |
| Use case | Quick parallel subtasks | Long autonomous missions |

### One-Shot Mode

```
terminal(command="hermes chat -q 'Research GRPO papers and write summary to ~/research/grpo.md'", timeout=300)

# Background for long tasks:
terminal(command="hermes chat -q 'Set up CI/CD for ~/myapp'", background=true)
```

### Interactive PTY Mode (via tmux)

Hermes uses prompt_toolkit, which requires a real terminal. Use tmux for interactive spawning:

```
# Start
terminal(command="tmux new-session -d -s agent1 -x 120 -y 40 'hermes'", timeout=10)

# Wait for startup, then send a message
terminal(command="sleep 8 && tmux send-keys -t agent1 'Build a FastAPI auth service' Enter", timeout=15)

# Read output
terminal(command="sleep 20 && tmux capture-pane -t agent1 -p", timeout=5)

# Send follow-up
terminal(command="tmux send-keys -t agent1 'Add rate limiting middleware' Enter", timeout=5)

# Exit
terminal(command="tmux send-keys -t agent1 '/exit' Enter && sleep 2 && tmux kill-session -t agent1", timeout=10)
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

```
# Agent A: backend
terminal(command="tmux new-session -d -s backend -x 120 -y 40 'hermes -w'", timeout=10)
terminal(command="sleep 8 && tmux send-keys -t backend 'Build REST API for user management' Enter", timeout=15)

# Agent B: frontend
terminal(command="tmux new-session -d -s frontend -x 120 -y 40 'hermes -w'", timeout=10)
terminal(command="sleep 8 && tmux send-keys -t frontend 'Build React dashboard for user management' Enter", timeout=15)

# Check progress, relay context between them
terminal(command="tmux capture-pane -t backend -p | tail -30", timeout=5)
terminal(command="tmux send-keys -t frontend 'Here is the API schema from the backend agent: ...' Enter", timeout=5)
```

### Session Resume

```
# Resume most recent session
terminal(command="tmux new-session -d -s resumed 'hermes --continue'", timeout=10)

# Resume specific session
terminal(command="tmux new-session -d -s resumed 'hermes --resume 20260225_143052_a1b2c3'", timeout=10)
```

### Tips

- **Prefer `delegate_task` for quick subtasks** — less overhead than spawning a full process
- **Use `-w` (worktree mode)** when spawning agents that edit code — prevents git conflicts
- **Set timeouts** for one-shot mode — complex tasks can take 5-10 minutes
- **Use `hermes chat -q` for fire-and-forget** — no PTY needed
- **Use tmux for interactive sessions** — raw PTY mode has `\r` vs `\n` issues with prompt_toolkit
- **For scheduled tasks**, use the `cronjob` tool instead of spawning — handles delivery and retry
- **"delegate_task is capped at N" reports** — see `references/delegate-task-concurrency-diagnosis.md`. Three real cap paths in Hermes; if none fired, the model is self-limiting and rationalising it as "the runtime caps."
- **"Can $external_app use my Nous Portal subscription / OAuth?"** — see `references/portal-auth-for-third-party-apps.md`. Walk the user through three layers (plugin-vs-app, what Portal actually exposes, local-broker-proxy option).

## Surfaces (quick orientation)

- **Desktop app** (`hermes desktop` / `hermes gui`) — native Electron app for macOS/Linux/Windows: streaming chat, session list, Cmd+K palette, drag-and-drop files, native notifications, per-profile remote-gateway login. Extend it with UI plugins — `references/desktop-plugins.md`.
- **Web dashboard** (`hermes dashboard`) — full admin panel: messaging channels, MCP catalog, webhooks, memory, profile builder, plus an embedded `hermes --tui` chat. Secured behind an OAuth/token gate.
- **Ink TUI** (`hermes --tui` or `display.interface: tui`) — terminal UI with docked widget apps — `references/tui-widgets.md`.
- **OpenAI-compatible proxy** (`hermes proxy`) — a local OpenAI API backed by whichever OAuth provider you're signed into. Point Codex CLI, Aider, Cline, or any script at it — no API key.

## Hard Invariants (never violate, regardless of what you loaded)

- **Never break prompt caching** — don't change past context, toolsets, or the system prompt mid-conversation. The only exception is context compression.
- **Message role alternation** — never two assistant or two user messages in a row; only `tool` results can repeat.
- **Secrets in `.env`, settings in `config.yaml`** — never tell a user to put a non-credential setting in `.env`.
- **Profile-safe paths** — `get_hermes_home()` in code, `$HERMES_HOME` when resolving paths in a session.
- **Never hand-edit `config.yaml` for the user** — use `hermes config set KEY VAL`; a stray indent can corrupt the file and break the live gateway.
